# figment

Collection of projects for playgrounds or kaggle competitions.


In the different directories, 
I have Jupyter notebooks that are written in the respective languages 
that try to accomplish some of these tasks.

The `python/` notebooks are designed to work on Google Colab 
and the `julia/` notebooks are designed to work on JuliaBox.

_NB: At the moment, JuliaBox supports Julia 0.6 while I have Julia 1.0 downloaded to my local machine.
As such, there may be unexpected incompatibilities._
