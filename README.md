# Figment

Collection of projects for data science, attempts at kaggle competitions, and learning new languages/techniques.

## Getting Started

In the different directories, 
I have Jupyter notebooks that are written in the respective languages.
This is structured so that I can organize different notebooks and test
the relevant libraries and techniques.

_Not all 'projects' will be written in multiple languages, 
but I will try to do that to have a nice comparison._

### Python

The `python/` notebooks are designed to work on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
Where possible, I'm trying to use Python3 because I have little experience with it compared to Python2.

My previous experience with Python has mostly involved physics analysis 
(software frameworks, plotting, and neural networks).
Here I am developing some solutions to kaggle competitions and trying out new libraries and techniques.

### Julia

I don't have any prior experience with [Julia](https://julialang.org/), 
so this is also a way for me to experiment with the language and develop some computer science skills.
The `julia/` notebooks are designed to work on [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/).

_NB: At the moment it seems JuliaBox supports Julia 0.6 while I have Julia 1.0 downloaded to my local machine.
There may be unintended incompatibilities._


## Projects

### Housing Prices

The kaggle housing prices [challenge]()
is being explored with a different set of notebooks in both `python` and `julia`.

#### Notebooks

Here is a table with a brief description of each notebook contained in the repository.

Notebook | About
-------- | -----
python/0-housing_prices.ipynb | Very basic and simple approach using one variable.
python/1-housing_prices.ipynb | Basic multivariate / ML techniques (including BDT with `XGBoost`)
python/2-housing_prices.ipynb | Basic deep learning approach with `keras+tensorflow`
python/3-housing_prices.ipynb | Basic deep learning approach with `pytorch`
julia/housing_prices.ipynb    | Learning `Julia` with basic deep learning approach with `Flux`
