# Figment

Collection of projects for data science, attempts at kaggle competitions, and learning new languages/techniques.
In the different directories, 
I have Jupyter notebooks that are written in the respective languages.

## Python

The `python/` notebooks are designed to work on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
Where possible, I'm trying to use Python3 because I have little experience with it compared to Python2.

My previous experience with Python has mostly involved physics analysis (software frameworks, plotting, and neural networks).
Here I am developing some solutions to kaggle competitions and trying out new libraries and techniques.

## Julia

The `julia/` notebooks are designed to work on [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/).
I don't have any prior experience with Julia, 
so this is also a way for me to experiment with a new language and develop my computer science skills.

_NB: At the moment it seems JuliaBox supports Julia 0.6 while I have Julia 1.0 downloaded to my local machine.
There may be unintended incompatibilities._
