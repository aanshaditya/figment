    "I do not have any experience with Julia, so I'm relying on tutorials that can be found on [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/) to guide me in data processing, plotting, and analysis ([here](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaBoxTutorials/blob/master/introductory-tutorials/broader-topics-and-ecosystem) they are on GitHub).  \n",

    "but we are using `Julia` instead of `python`!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this isn't a unique challenge, I'll refer you to the python notebooks for the exploratory analysis.  For this notebook, I will mostly be playing around with `Julia` (trying to learn it) and specifically, the `Flux` module."
